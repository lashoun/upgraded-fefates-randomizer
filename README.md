# Upgraded FEFates Randomizer

This is a barbaric but working improvement of thane89's [Fire Emblem Fates Randomizer](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wip-fire-emblem-fates-randomizer.452268/).

## Features

On the one hand, I refined the randomizer's algorithm in order to provide a more enjoyable game experience. The biggest selling point is the possibility to do a Pick My Units run: if you wish, you can use the `-pmu` option to get a PMU list of 16 units to use, that you will find in the `PMUClassSpread.csv` file generated by the script.

On the other hand, I set out to upgrade the whole Fire Emblem experience (visuals, Birthright difficulty, weapons, classes). Those upgrades are optional.

### Randomizer Features

By default the randomizer works as explained below. Customizations are possible with the many options provided; if you do not understand, you may also read the code, which should be relatively easy to grasp.

- Each character is given a new total amount of Lvl 1 base stats (by default between 15 and 25) and growth rates (by default between 250 and 350), which are partially randomly distributed, and those stats are scaled back to the level at which they are recruited.
    - For instance, if Ryoma is put in Hinata's recruitment spot (so he will be Lvl 9) and assigned the Archer class, then his stats will be his Lvl 1 stats adjusted with 8 levels of (Ryoma's base growths + Archer class growths);
- Similar to the original randomizer, stats are then shuffled a bit. The default settings are:
    - 10 passes per character, with each pass having:
        - 100% chance of shuffling 5% of growths
        - 50% chance of shuffling 1 stat point
        - 25% chance of shuffling 1 modifier point
- Random swaps of stats / growths / mods can occur (always all three, except for Lck):
    - Str / Mag (default: according to class, 0% chance to swap)
    - Skl / Spd (default: 20% chance to swap)
    - Def / Res (default: according to class, 20% chance to swap)
    - Lck / ? (default: [Lck Growth]% chance, only if Lck stat / growth / mod is superior)
- "Catch 'em all" mode by default: the randomizer will minimize duplicate final classes according to the chosen route (can be disabled with `--disable-class-spread`)
- There is an option to keep all characters at their usual spot but still have the class and stats modifications (option `--disable-model-switch`)
- Minor updates to recruitment levels to make some characters more viable; Hayato joins at Lvl 7 instead of 1 in Birthright, for instance. Can be disabled with `--disable-rebalance-levels`

#### Chapters
- Changed all "Rout the enemy" objectives to "Defeat the boss"
- Most chapters have a 20-turn limit
- Free Heart Seal given after chapter 5
- Most bosses have been buffed with better weapons
- Endgame chapters of each route should allow the player to save (not tested)
- Birthright Lunatic has been made more difficult: most enemies now have skills
- Birthright Chapter 10 and Revelations Chapter 11 (Ninja village) have one tile changed so that the door is accessible without flier
- Birthright Chapter 11: Reina now spawns on the boat

#### Weapons
- Changes to weapon triangles: Tome <-> Axe, Dagger <-> Sword, and Bow <-> Lance become neutral
    - Rationale: range weapons can already hit melee weapons without retaliation so they shouldn't have weapon advantage on top of that
- Weapon rank requirements decreased by one for every weapon: for instance, iron weapons are available from rank E.
- Weapon updates: increased the difference between Hoshidan and Nohrian weapons, nerfed the hell out of those busted hidden weapons, doubled Staff Exp for convenience. The changes only concern Bronze / Iron / Steel / Silver weapons.

- Wakizashi, Spear, Tomahawk and Battering Club are now 1-2 range, but have -10 Hit and -10 Avo
- All hidden weapons that were not Bronze / Iron / Steel / Silver have -2 Mt and -20 Hit, and all stat debuffs are decreased by 1
- Silver weapons no longer self-debuff, but instead have -10 Hit, -10 Avo, and give -2 Def/Res and -3 eff. Spd in enemy phase
    - Enemies have "Silver Weapons+" which do not have any of the aforementioned maluses
- Beaststones+ and Dragonstones+ now halve Str/Mag until the end of the next fight

#### Characters
- Corrin gets Aptitude, Dragon Fang, Draconic Hex, Nohrian Trust and Hoshidan Unity so you can reclass them immediately after chapter 5; replace Draconic Hex with Nobility if you want the early game to remain interesting

## Instructions

### Requirements

You will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and the [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict) module. I advise using virtual environments but for the layman a simple
```
pip install numpy xmltodict
```
should do the trick.
The instructions can look daunting but once you understand how it works it takes fewer than 5 minutes to do. Some experience with Python and/or tinkering with files will obviously help though.

0. Begin by either cloning the repository or downloading and extracting the zip.
1. First, choose which version of Fates you want to play (all versions except Vanilla are only compatible with the Special Edition, unfortunately):
    - _Vanilla Fates_: for copyright-related reasons, you will have to dump your own romfs. Follow the instructions in thane89's original readme below. Copy the `castle`, `GameData`, `m`, `Scripts` folders into a folder that will be hence called the `romfs` folder.
    - **_Upgraded Fates_ (recommended)**: patched with my curated upgrades listed above. **No need to dump any romfs in that case!** Extract all the `.7z` archives, i.e., `fates_upgraded_decompressed.7z` into a `fates_upgraded_decompressed` folder and `fates_upgraded_fixed{/2/3}.7z` into a single `fates_upgraded_fixed` folder. The `fixed` folder contains mainly visuals and things the randomizer does not affect so you do not have to manipulate it until step 12. The `decompressed` folder will henceforth be referred to as the `romfs` folder.
2. Run `Fates Randomizer Beta 5-5.jar`, click "Open and Verify", and select the `romfs` folder. You should see a new window pop up with options. If you do not, the window will show you which file was not found. Make sure that the selected folder has folders named `castle`, `GameData`, `m`, `Scripts` directly inside it.
3. Select a path and options. Refer to the [original post](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wip-fire-emblem-fates-randomizer.452268/) if you do not understand an option. I recommend selecting `All Routes` (even if you plan to play Birthright or Conquest, the Python script has route options too) and all options except the experimental ones and the stat randomization.
4. Hit "Randomize" and let the program sit. When the program finishes, a little notification will pop up in the corner of the window.
5. Close `Fates Randomizer Beta 5-5.jar`.
6. Copy the `RandomizerSettings.xml` file from the `romfs` folder to the `data` folder.
7. Open a command prompt in the same folder as `updated_randomizer.py`. Run
```
python updated_randomizer.py
```
  - If you want to know about the options, type:
```
python updated_randomizer.py -h
```
  - Refer to the section "All Options" below for the details.
  - If you did not select the option "Anna" / "Amiibo characters" / "Children" in the randomizer, you have to use the options `-ba` / `-bac` / `-bc` respectively.

8. If the script ran successfully, you should have three files named `RandomizerSettingsUpdated.xml`, `ClassSpread.csv` and `PMUClassSpread.csv` in the `data` folder. Otherwise, try to run one more time, and if it fails again, raise an issue on this repository.
    - `RandomizerSettingsUpdated.xml` contains the detailed information of the randomized run. For each character, the `StringData` and `ClassData` fields are tied to the character while the other fields are tied to their spot. If Ryoma has as "switchingCharacter" Hinata, he will have the stats that are written in Hinata's `Stats` field (but those stats will have been computed as Ryoma's "expected" stats at this spot). I recommend not looking at it for more fun.
    - `ClassSpread.csv` contains on each line the original character, their replacement and the class assigned to the replacement. I recommend respecting the file's assignements for more fun and challenge.
    - `PMUClassSpread.csv` (if you selected the `-pmu` option) contains a PMU subset of the previous file.
10. Delete the `romfs` folder and repeat steps 1-5 but, in step 3, choose "Custom Path" and select `RandomizerSettingsUpdated.xml`. Check the "Join Order" options, otherwise the randomization will not be complete. (In particular, the characters will have the same weapons as vanilla when they join, which is problematic if their class changed as they will not be able to use them.) The randomizer should after clicking the `Randomize` button. In the rare case where it does not, it means that the `xml` file isn't legal (despite extensive testing I could not make the Python script 100% compliant); re-running the Python script should fix this in most cases. If the problem persists, simply repeat the whole procedure from step 1.
11. Close `Fates Randomizer Beta 5-5.jar`. Open `FEAT.exe`. Drag the `romfs` folder into FEAT: this will recompress the files. Once FEAT is done, you can close it.
12. Phew! You're done! Now you can copy your `romfs` folder to the mods folder of your gaming medium. If you chose the upgraded version, also copy the contents of the `fixed` folder inside the `romfs` folder if you did not do so already, and the `exefs` folder to the mods folder.
13. As a final note, DO NOT use this on top of an existing save or branch of fate. Use a fresh save starting from the very beginning if you want a stable playthrough.

### Example Custom Run
```
python updated_randomizer.py -bc -bssmin 15 -bssmax 20 -dms -edbc -egd -epa -erps -g "Birthright" -gsmax 350 -gsmin 280 -ic "Enchanter,Warden" -mc 5 -ns 4 -pmu
```

This example command (that I personally use) will ensure the following:
- `-bc` bans the children from the randomization
- `-bssmin 15` and `-bssmax 20` ensure that all units will have a total Lvl 1 base stats sum randomly sampled between 15 and 20
- `-dms` ensures that character models will not be swapped (every character stays the same visually)
- `-edbc` ensures that non-promoted units who are assigned a DLC class will get a fitting base class
- `-egd` ensures that DLC classes are not gender-locked
- `-epa` ensures that Mozu's replacement will have Aptitude
- `-erps` will make the `ClassSpread.csv` and `PMUClassSpread.csv` files have a randomization of personal skills; you will have to manually edit them into the game, e.g. with [Paragon](https://github.com/thane98/paragon)
- `-g "Birthright"` ensures that only Birthright replacement units will be updated
- `-gsmax 350` and `-gsmin 280` ensure that all units will have a total growth rates sum randomly sampled between 280 and 350
- `-ic "Enchanter,Warden"` ensures that classes Enchanter and Warden will each be attributed to a character, who are in the PMU list since `-pmu` is checked
- `-mc 5` ensures that all unit stat modifiers will be increased by 5
- `-ns 4` ensures that all units will have 4 randomized skills at recruitment
- `-pmu` enables the PMU mode of the randomization

## Troubleshooting

### Chapter 2: There's an immobile "phantom" unit near the top left corner!
This sometimes happens. Just kill it after the others, you should be able to.

### Chapter 5: This chapter is way too hard!
I advise using the Infinite Movement cheat code for this chapter. If you can play Randomized Fates, you can probably find how to use cheats on your gaming medium.

### Conquest Chapter 9: Talking with Nyx crashes the game!
Break the wall near Nyx before talking to her. 

### Conquest Chapter 16: The game freezes after the "Spare Shura" prompt!
You need to rename or delete the file `Scripts/B/B016.cmb`. This might skip the prompt in its entirety, meaning you won't get anything, but at least you can play the rest of the route.

### Revelations Chapter 8: Hayato was not replaced!
This is an issue from the original randomizer; I can't fix it myself. This can amusingly lead to recruiting two Hayatos.

### Revelations Chapter 13: The obstacles are invisible!
This is a known issue. No fix for this at the moment.
